I really suck at coding, but i do like it. You can create so much with it and its a big feild. This week i played a game about coding for my interactive gaming class and it felt easy compared to this. Alot of people siad it was hard and for me it was an easy game. It was simple actions and it just shows i have learned things from this class. I wanted this to look kinda like a basket ball dribbling.
