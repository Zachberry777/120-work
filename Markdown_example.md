HW-2 response

This week was very very difficult for me initially to set up my development environment.

I had to use Powershell and alot of other apps to do two assignments. First was Text1 and had to use to learn the new apps. Second was HW-2 which is this one and write about what we did.

I worked hours and hours on this. First i read and watched all the videos. After that i downloaded everything and signed in. I then did the homework and tried. I failed and looked at what people had to say. Then i watched your video and fallowed along.

 I had to read and try my self, then look for help, and then last i had to wing it a little. i read about most of the problems in the class repo. They all had really good ideas.

How to save this as a repository more, that is what i would like to learn more.

I had alot of issues this week and hopefully next week i can understand more so i can be part of helping people.
