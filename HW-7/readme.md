Why this coding is working the way it is, becasue of the begining. It all started with a letter or a word. This started with var ball, which made it what it was going to be through the rest of the lesson. Some of the lines make the canvas and the ball, some determan where the ball will hit and go. Some line color the canvas and the moving object. To make the ball change direction you have to mess around with the numbers. Play with it and you will find out.

I altered the balls color and size, i gave it a stroke and made the background red. i made the back red and the ball blue because those colors go well together. I then made the stroke orange so the ball was a nice contrasting color so it was easy on the eyes. I also messed with the numbers to change the speed of it.
