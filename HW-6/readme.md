Zachary Hockenberry, 50


This week was pretty fun messy around with everything and trying new stuff. Its close to Halloween and i made an abstract clown. It was fun to mess with and to have fun with it. I had some troubles with adam this week. It wouldnt start so i had to redownload it. Also i dont know how to make these show so ill have to go into your office again tuesday.
