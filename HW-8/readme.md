This reminds me of the background being balck and the dots being white and its a still picture. But when you look around the white dots look like they are flickering. I wanted to reccreate that but make it alive. I wanted to make it blue because i wanted it to feel coszy and easy on the eye to look at. It didnt take a whole lot to make but with so little it can create alot to look at. It make yours eyes flow across the screen and yours eyes dont stop.
