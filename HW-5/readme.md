This is my head getting hit by a paddle or a news paper. I got the idea my myself trying to hit a fly out of the air with a magazine, i thought it would be funny to see my floating head getting hit by a magazine or paddle. I did what the professor did and did some diffrent takes on it so i had my own twist and personalit to it. Hoped you guys enjoyed this funny idea.
